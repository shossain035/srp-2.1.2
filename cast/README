CAST stub README
----------------

The code in this directory consists of stubs for the CAST-128 encryption
algorithm.  I have unbundled the internal CAST implementation from the
SRP distribution (along with all other encryption algorithms) to make
SRP easier to distribute worldwide.

If you are using OpenSSL, these stubs should interface with the OpenSSL
library's CAST implementation.  If you use another cryptographic library
without CAST, like GNU MP or CryptoLib, and you want to use CAST, and
you're in the United States or Canada, contact me at <tjw@cs.stanford.edu>
and I'll send you a copy.  Unpack 'cast.tar.gz' in the top-level SRP
distribution directory, and it will replace the stubs in this directory
with the real thing.
