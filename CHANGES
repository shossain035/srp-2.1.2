    Jeffrey Altman <jaltman@columbia.edu> for reporting this bug.

  (base) Incorporated OpenBSD support.

  (telnet) Added SRP Username prompt when -l option is not provided
    on the command line.

Version 1.5.0:

  (telnet) Added support for integrity-protected encryption
    flags in telnet and telnetd.  This ensures that negotiation
    of encryption cannot be disabled or compromised by an active
    attacker.  These flags will be reflected in the upcoming SRP
    Telnet RFCs.

    Linux glibc.

  (base) Fixed compile-time errors under RedHat 6.0.  The two main

        Joseph Gooch <mrwizard@psu.edu>

Version 1.4.4:

  (telnet) Incorporated recently published IPv6 patches for
    telnet98.  INET6 support is now a configurable option,
    and is enabled with the --with-inet6 option to configure.

  (telnet) Fixed some minor configuration errors, like the
    misdetection of UTMPX on some systems.

  (libsrp) Fixed the truerand bug under Linux/glibc.  Apparently,
    signal handlers have their own signals blocked for the
    duration of the handler, but since the handler in truerand
    longjmp'ed out instead of returning, the signal routines
    never realized that the execution context had left the
    handler, so the original signal never got unblocked.
    To fix this, truerand now uses volatile static variables to
    manage the timer signaling.

  (base) Fixed the DES_RPC configuration problem under Linux.
    Also fixed other minor compilation glitches.

  (ftp) Fixed a small compilation error with logwtmp.

  (inst) Added some more bulletproofing to the install scripts.
    Each script verifies that the binaries are present before
    starting, and they prompt the user before installing each
    executable.  A PATH lookup feature has been added to
    accommodate weird systems.

Version 1.4.3:

  (telnet) Fixed errors in configure.in for some platforms.
    On FreeBSD, the DEFAULT_IM was improperly quoted in
    configure.in.  This has been fixed.

  (telnet) -lutil added for those platforms that need it.

  (java) Documentation has been added to some files.

  (libsrp) Bugfix for Digital Unix added.
    Using optimization with the wrong compiler resulted in
    an infinite loop in t_truerand.c.  #ifdefs have been
    added around a new fixed declaration.

Version 1.4.2:

  (libsrp) First cut at NIS support in EPS.
    NIS support is turned on with "./configure --with-nis" in libsrp.
    The API has been slightly changed to accommodate NIS:
    The old t_openpw() and t_openconf() API has been superceded
    by the gettpent()/gettpnam()/settpent()/endtpent() interface,
    which functions exactly like the standard getpwnam()/... calls
    in libc, NIS support and all.

    The old t_open... API is retained solely for the purpose of
    manipulating tpasswd and tconf-formatted files.

  (telnet,ftp,base) The new libsrp API is now used to obtain
    user verifiers.  Changes are trivial.

  A README.NIS file has been added to the main distribution directory
  to assist installers.

Version 1.4.1:

  (telnet) Fixed hanging telnetd problem on HP-UX.
    This problem was caused by a race condition that occurred when
    telnetd fork()ed a child process to execute "/bin/login".
    The signal catcher in the child process now times out to
    avoid this condition.

  (telnet) Linux telnetd now uses correct pathnames for utmp and wtmp.
    Telnetd had "/etc/utmp" and "/etc/wtmp" hardcoded in, which
    broke on Linux systems.  Telnetd now uses the appropriate
    system macros to locate these files.

  (eps) Miscellaneous bug fixes.
    The "passwd" program did not handle a missing configuration file
    gracefully, and various messages needed to be cleaned up for
    accuracy.  A few potential buffer overruns were also fixed.
