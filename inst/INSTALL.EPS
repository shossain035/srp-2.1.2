Installing the Exponential Password Suite on UNIX systems
=========================================================

If you obtained the EPS as a binary distribution, unpack the
archive in a temporary directory.  If you are compiling from source,
this directory should have links to the appropriate executables.

This installation must be done as root.  Note that the SRP-enabled
telnet and ftp require the EPS in order to perform secure
authentication.

MAKE SURE YOU READ THE TESTING SECTION AT THE END OF THIS DOCUMENT!!!


INSTALLATION STEPS
==================

0.  For an automatic installation, run the "installeps" script
    in this directory as root, e.g.

      # ./installeps

    You SHOULD make BACKUPS of your original programs (the installeps
    script will make ".orig" backups automatically, but it pays to be
    on the safe side).

    If this does not succeed, or if you prefer to install by hand,
    refer to the remaining instructions below.

1.  BACKUP your original login, su and passwd programs.

2.  Install the "passwd" utility.  Find out where "passwd" resides
    on your system (usually /bin or /usr/bin), and replace it with
    the EPS passwd, optionally saving a copy of the original:

      # mv /bin/passwd /bin/passwd.orig
      # cp passwd /bin
      # chmod 4711 /bin/passwd

    Like the original passwd, the EPS passwd needs to be setuid root.

3.  Intall the "tconf" utility.  It is recommended that you place it
    in the same directory as the "passwd" command:

      # cp tconf /bin

    It can also be placed in admin utility directories such as
    /sbin or /usr/sbin.

4.  Run "tconf".  It is recommended that you start off with a
    1024-bit field size.  You should initially use the default
    1024-bit field size in tconf ,since generating large fields can be
    very time-consuming.  Once everything is installed and tested and
    you have more time, you can run tconf again to generate your
    own field.

    You should also create a zero-length file /etc/tpasswd and set its
    mode as desired:  either world-readable (0644) or shadowed (0600).

5.  (Optional) Install the "login" and "su" utilities in the same way
    that you installed "passwd".  Although your vendor's "login" and "su"
    will still continue to work with the new EPS suite, installing the
    new login and su programs reduces the number of programs that
    depend on the old-style UNIX password format.

Each user should now use the "passwd" command to update their passwords.


TESTING
=======

IF YOU INSTALLED /bin/login MAKE SURE YOU TEST YOUR SYSTEM *BEFORE* LOGGING
OUT.  You should perform the following steps:

1. Try and telnet into your machine.

2. Try and rlogin into your machine.

3. Physically go to another computer and open a telnet session into
   the console where you are installing EPS login (so you have access
   to the machine if the following step does not work).  Logout of
   the console and try to log in on the console.

4. If any of the above steps failed, replace the EPS login with
   your original login program (login is optional anyways).
