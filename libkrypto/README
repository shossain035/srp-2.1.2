			LIBKRYPTO README


Libkrypto is a generic interface to stream and block ciphers and one-way
hash functions.  In addition the library contains routines which
implement a protocol for sending and receiving "private" encrypted
messages and "safe" messages which contain a message authentication
code (MAC).

The library currently supports BLOWFISH, DES, DES3, and CAST5 ciphers,
ECB, CBC, CFB64 and OFB64 modes, and MD5 and SHA hash functions.

The following is a brief description of the format of "private" and
"safe" messages.  For the formats, all numbers are sent big endian,
numbers in parenthesis indicate lengths.

SAFE FORMAT

pvno (4)
msg-type (4)
safe-body
  length (4)
  user-data (var)
  sequence-number (4)
checksum (var)


PRIVATE FORMAT

pvno (4)
msg-type (4)
enc-body
  confounder (8)
  checksum (var)
  length (4)
  user-data (var)
  sequence-number (4)
  pad (var)

The implementations in libkrypto are based on the following distributions.
The cipher mode code (cipher_crypt_cbc, cipher_crypt_cfb,
cipher_crypt_ecb, cipher_crypt_ofb) and the Blowfish code
(cipher_imp_blowfish) are based on Eric Young's Blowfish distribution
and are copyrighted by Eric Young.  The DES code (cipher_imp_des)
is based on Eric Young's DES distribution and is copyrighted by Eric Young.
The IDEA code (cipher_imp_idea) is based on the source code in Bruce
Schneier's Applied Cryptography, 2nd ed.  The SHA code (hash_imp_sha)
and the random confounder code are based on the libcrypto routines in the
Kerberos 5 patch level 1 distribution (krb5-1.0pl1) and are copyrighted by
MIT.  The MD5 code (hash_imp_md5) was written by Colin Plumb.

Update:  As of version 1.7.1 libkrypto has been largely reworked to
function as a wrapper around cipher and hash implementations in
underlying cryptography libraries, like OpenSSL, cryptolib, and libdes.
libkrypto no longer contains native implementations of its own.
